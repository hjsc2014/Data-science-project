Revised Plan:
1.	Order the original dataset by mean HbA1c and requesting postcode.
2.	Enter list of postcodes into the English indices of deprivation database to return deprivation data https://imd-by-postcode.opendatacommunities.org/imd/2019
3.	This returned a new dataset contained mean HbA1c by various markers of deprivation which I fully anonymised to ensure there were no single results identifiable.
4.	I excluded postcodes with number of requests <20

My new questions were then as follows:
1.	What is the distribution of HbA1c requests by geographic area? LSOA code will be used from a public data source.
2.	Can the difference in numbers of requests be explained by:
a.	Social deprivation using index of multiple deprivation?
b.	Health and disability status?
c.	Prevalence of diabetes (I donâ€™t have this info in my dataset but further work could be to find this data)
3.	Is mean/median HbA1c influenced by:
a.	Social deprivation using index of multiple deprivation?
b.	Health and disability status?
